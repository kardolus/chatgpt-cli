## Features

* **Streaming mode**: Real-time interaction with the GPT model.
* **Query mode**: Single input-output interactions with the GPT model.
* **Interactive mode**: The interactive mode allows for a more conversational experience with the model. Prints the
  token usage when combined with query mode.
* **Thread-based context management**: Enjoy seamless conversations with the GPT model with individualized context for
  each thread, much like your experience on the OpenAI website. Each unique thread has its own history, ensuring
  relevant and coherent responses across different chat instances.
* **Sliding window history**: To stay within token limits, the chat history automatically trims while still preserving
  the necessary context. The size of this window can be adjusted through the `context-window` setting.
* **Custom context from any source**: You can provide the GPT model with a custom context during conversation. This
  context can be piped in from any source, such as local files, standard input, or even another program. This
  flexibility allows the model to adapt to a wide range of conversational scenarios.
* **Model listing**: Access a list of available models using the `-l` or `--list-models` flag.
* **Thread listing**: Display a list of active threads using the `--list-threads` flag.
* **Advanced configuration options**: The CLI supports a layered configuration system where settings can be specified
  through default values, a `config.yaml` file, and environment variables. For quick adjustments,
  various `--set-<value>` flags are provided. To verify your current settings, use the `--config` or `-c` flag.
* **Availability Note**: This CLI supports gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, and Perplexity’s models (e.g.,
  llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online). However, the specific ChatGPT model used on chat.openai.com may not be available
  via the OpenAI API.

### Prompt Support

We’re excited to introduce support for prompt files with the `--prompt` flag in **version 1.7.1**! This feature
allows you to provide a rich and detailed context for your conversations directly from a file.

#### Using the `--prompt` Flag

The `--prompt` flag lets you specify a file containing the initial context or instructions for your ChatGPT
conversation. This is especially useful when you have detailed instructions or context that you want to reuse across
different conversations.

To use the `--prompt` flag, pass the path of your prompt file like this:

```shell
chatgpt --prompt path/to/your/prompt.md "Use a pipe or provide a query here"
```

The contents of `prompt.md` will be read and used as the initial context for the conversation, while the query you
provide directly will serve as the specific question or task you want to address.

#### Example

Here’s a fun example where you can use the output of a `git diff` command as a prompt:

```shell
git diff | chatgpt --prompt ../prompts/write_pull-request.md
```

In this example, the content from the `write_pull-request.md` prompt file is used to guide the model's response based on
the diff data from `git diff`.

```

#### FreeBSD (arm64)

```shell
curl -L -o chatgpt https://github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/releases/latest/download/chatgpt-freebsd-arm64 && chmod +x chatgpt && sudo mv chatgpt /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows (amd64)

Download the binary
from [this link](https://github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/releases/latest/download/chatgpt-windows-amd64.exe) and add it
to your PATH.

Choose the appropriate command for your system, which will download the binary, make it executable, and move it to your
/usr/local/bin directory (or %PATH% on Windows) for easy access.

## Getting Started

1. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to
   your [ChatGPT secret key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). To set the environment variable, you can add
   the following line to your shell profile (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile), replacing your_api_key with
   your actual key:

    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    ```

2. To enable history tracking across CLI calls, create a ~/.chatgpt-cli directory using the command:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/.chatgpt-cli
    ```

   Once this directory is in place, the CLI automatically manages the message history for each "thread" you converse
   with. The history operates like a sliding window, maintaining context up to a configurable token maximum. This
   ensures a balance between maintaining conversation context and achieving optimal performance.

   By default, if a specific thread is not provided by the user, the CLI uses the default thread and stores the history
   at `~/.chatgpt-cli/history/default.json`. You can find more details about how to configure the `thread` parameter in
   the
   [Configuration](#configuration) section of this document.

3. Try it out:

    ```shell
    chatgpt what is the capital of the Netherlands
    ```

4. To start interactive mode, use the `-i` or `--interactive` flag:

    ```shell
    chatgpt --interactive
    ```

   If you want the CLI to automatically create a new thread for each session, ensure that the `auto_create_new_thread`
   configuration variable is set to `true`. This will create a unique thread identifier for each interactive session.

5. To use the pipe feature, create a text file containing some context. For example, create a file named context.txt
   with the following content:

    ```shell
    Kya is a playful dog who loves swimming and playing fetch.
    ```

   Then, use the pipe feature to provide this context to ChatGPT:

    ```shell
    cat context.txt | chatgpt "What kind of toy would Kya enjoy?"
    ```

6. To list all available models, use the -l or --list-models flag:

    ```shell
    chatgpt --list-models
    ```

7. For more options, see:

   ```shell
   chatgpt --help
   ```

## Configuration

The ChatGPT CLI adopts a four-tier configuration strategy, with different levels of precedence assigned to flags,
environment variables, a config.yaml file, and default values, in that respective order:

1. Flags: Command-line flags have the highest precedence. Any value provided through a flag will override other
   configurations.
2. Environment Variables: If a setting is not specified by a flag, the corresponding environment variable (prefixed with
   the name field from the config) will be checked.
3. Config file (config.yaml): If neither a flag nor a environment variable is set, the value from the config.yaml file
   will be used.
4. Default Values: If no value is specified through flags, config.yaml, or environment variables, the CLI will fall back
   to its built-in default values.

| `auth_token_prefix` | The prefix to be added before the token in the `auth_header`.                                                                                          | 'Bearer '                      |

### Custom Config and Data Directory

By default, ChatGPT CLI stores configuration and history files in the `~/.chatgpt-cli` directory. However, you can
easily
override these locations by setting environment variables, allowing you to store configuration and history in custom
directories.

| Environment Variable | Description                                  | Default Location         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `OPENAI_CONFIG_HOME` | Overrides the default config directory path. | `~/.chatgpt-cli`         |
| `OPENAI_DATA_HOME`   | Overrides the default data directory path.   | `~/.chatgpt-cli/history` |

#### Example for Custom Directories

To change the default configuration or data directories, set the appropriate environment variables:

```
export OPENAI_CONFIG_HOME="/custom/config/path"
export OPENAI_DATA_HOME="/custom/data/path"
```

If these environment variables are not set, the application defaults to ~/.chatgpt-cli for configuration files and ~
/.chatgpt-cli/history for history.

#### Variables for interactive mode:

- `%date`: The current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `%time`: The current time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
- `%datetime`: The current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- `%counter`: The total number of queries in the current session.
- `%usage`: The usage in total tokens used (only works in query mode).

The defaults can be overridden by providing your own values in the user configuration file. The structure of this file
mirrors that of the default configuration. For instance, to override
the `model` and `max_tokens` parameters, your file might look like this:

```yaml
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
max_tokens: 4096
```

This alters the `model` to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` and adjusts `max_tokens` to `4096`. All other options, such as `url`
, `completions_path`, and `models_path`, can similarly be modified. If the user configuration file cannot be accessed or
is missing, the application will resort to the default configuration.

Another way to adjust values without manually editing the configuration file is by using environment variables.
The `name` attribute forms the prefix for these variables. As an example, the `model` can be modified using
the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable. Similarly, to disable history during the execution of a command, use:

```shell
OPENAI_OMIT_HISTORY=true chatgpt what is the capital of Denmark?
```

This approach is especially beneficial for temporary changes or for testing varying configurations.

Moreover, you can use the `--config` or `-c` flag to view the present configuration. This handy feature allows users to
swiftly verify their current settings without the need to manually inspect the configuration files.

```shell
chatgpt --config
```

Executing this command will display the active configuration, including any overrides instituted by environment
variables or the user configuration file.

To facilitate convenient adjustments, the ChatGPT CLI provides flags for swiftly modifying the `model`, `thread`
, `context-window` and `max_tokens` parameters in your user configured `config.yaml`. These flags are `--set-model`
, `--set-thread`, `--set-context-window` and `--set-max-tokens`.

For instance, to update the model, use the following command:

```shell
chatgpt --set-model gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
```

This feature allows for rapid changes to key configuration parameters, optimizing your experience with the ChatGPT CLI.

### Azure Configuration

For Azure, use a configuration similar to:

```yaml
name: azure
api_key: <your_key>
model: <not relevant, read from the completions path>
max_tokens: 4096
context_window: 8192
role: You are a helpful assistant.
temperature: 1
top_p: 1
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
thread: default
omit_history: false
url: https://<your_resource>.openai.azure.com
completions_path: /openai/deployments/<your_deployment>/chat/completions?api-version=<your_api>

### Command-Line Autocompletion

Enhance your CLI experience with our new autocompletion feature for command flags!

#### Enabling Autocompletion

Autocompletion is currently supported for the following shells: Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell. To activate flag
completion in your current shell session, execute the appropriate command based on your shell:

- **Bash**
    ```bash
    . <(chatgpt --set-completions bash)
    ```
- **Zsh**
    ```zsh
    . <(chatgpt --set-completions zsh)
    ```
- **Fish**
    ```fish
    chatgpt --set-completions fish | source
    ```
- **PowerShell**
    ```powershell
    chatgpt --set-completions powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
    ```

#### Persistent Autocompletion

For added convenience, you can make autocompletion persist across all new shell sessions by adding the appropriate
sourcing command to your shell's startup file. Here are the files typically used for each shell:

- **Bash**: Add to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
- **Zsh**: Add to `.zshrc`
- **Fish**: Add to `config.fish`
- **PowerShell**: Add to your PowerShell profile script

For example, for Bash, you would add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
. <(chatgpt --set-completions bash)
```

This ensures that command flag autocompletion is enabled automatically every time you open a new terminal window.

## Markdown Rendering

You can render markdown in real-time using the `mdrender.sh` script, located [here](scripts/mdrender.sh). You'll first
need to
install [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).

Example:

```shell
chatgpt write a hello world program in Java | ./scripts/mdrender.sh
```

## Development

To start developing, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to
your [ChatGPT secret key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Using the Makefile
The Makefile simplifies development tasks by providing several targets for testing, building, and deployment.

* **all-tests**: Run all tests, including linting, formatting, and go mod tidy.
  ```shell 
  make all-tests
  ```
* **binaries**: Build binaries for multiple platforms.
  ```shell 
  make binaries
  ```
* **shipit**: Run the release process, create binaries, and generate release notes.
  ```shell 
  make shipit
  ```
* **updatedeps**: Update dependencies and commit any changes.
  ```shell 
  make updatedeps
  ```

For more available commands, use:
```shell
make help
```

#### Windows build script

```ps1
.\scripts\binaries.ps1
```

### Testing the CLI
1. After a successful build, test the application with the following command:

    ```shell
    ./bin/chatgpt what type of dog is a Jack Russel?
    ```

2. As mentioned previously, the ChatGPT CLI supports tracking conversation history across CLI calls. This feature
   creates a seamless and conversational experience with the GPT model, as the history is utilized as context in
   subsequent interactions.

   To enable this feature, you need to create a `~/.chatgpt-cli` directory using the command:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/.chatgpt-cli
    ```

## Uninstallation

If for any reason you wish to uninstall the ChatGPT CLI application from your system, you can do so by following these
steps:

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

If you installed the CLI using Homebrew you can do:

```shell
brew uninstall chatgpt-cli
```

And to remove the tap:

```shell
brew untap kardolus/chatgpt-cli
```

### MacOS / Linux

If you installed the binary directly, follow these steps:

1. Remove the binary:

    ```shell
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/chatgpt
    ```

2. Optionally, if you wish to remove the history tracking directory, you can also delete the `~/.chatgpt-cli` directory:

    ```shell
    rm -rf ~/.chatgpt-cli
    ```

### Windows

1. Navigate to the location of the `chatgpt` binary in your system, which should be in your PATH.

2. Delete the `chatgpt` binary.

3. Optionally, if you wish to remove the history tracking, navigate to the `~/.chatgpt-cli` directory (where `~` refers
   to your user's home directory) and delete it.

Please note that the history tracking directory `~/.chatgpt-cli` only contains conversation history and no personal
data. If you have any concerns about this, please feel free to delete this directory during uninstallation.
